# Ubuntu 18.04 telemetry
Since Ubuntu 18.04 (Codename: Bionic Beaver), Canonical implemented a "opt-out-telemtry" strategy. In this context "opt-out" describes the technology to collect data in terms of the user behavior and the computer hardware.

This includes the following data:
* Ubuntu Flavour
* Ubuntu Version
* Network connectivity or not
* CPU family
* RAM
* Disk(s) size
* Screen(s) resolution
* GPU vendor and model
* OEM Manufacturer
* Location (based on the location  selected at install)
* Installation duration (time taken)
* Auto login enabled or not
* Disk layout selected
* Third party software selected or not
* Download updates during install or not
* LivePatch enabled or not

According to Will Cooke Canonical (Director of Ubuntu Deskto) tries to reach the goal to find and solve Ubuntu issues. Truely this is going to improve the quality stability. Nevertheless these mechanisms can be used abusively, which makes these mechanisms not always helpful.
Some people may classify these tools as _spyware_.

# Disabling the telemtry
There are four basic tools, which are collecting data.
1. **ubuntu-report**: reports hardware and other metrics.
2. **popularity-contest**: reports informations about the installed software.
3. **apport**: generated/sends crash-report.
4. **whoopsie**: sends report generated by apport.

First of all, all the hostnames are going to be resolved to the local host, which has the effect, that all these hostnames are no longer reachable.
Second, all the recently mentioned tools are removed from the machine.  

This affects the global machine, not just a single user.

## Alternative
Alternatively you can download and install the docker image __ubuntu:bionic__.
